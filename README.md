"Awersome" GameBoy Emulator and Programmng Language Project 

This project is such a challenge for me, will I be able to create a working tool to run, debug and develop software/games for GameBoy consoles.
At this moment I plan to support only original GameBoy, it doesn't mean that I won't want to extend possibilities of the program in future, I just have to start from A to end on Z

At first I will put here all documents which I will create. Only after I create the first version of the program (i.e. capable of running games) it will be placed here.
